Prompt (Deepseek)
I need to integrate Google Appps Script into the Sentiment Analysis app to fix the next info in logs: 
Timestamp (ts_iso)
Review (which is randomly selected)
Sentiment (with confidence)
Meta (this includes all information from the client)
The code for creating app is here <>. Modify that app and output new .js and .html files ready to deploy
